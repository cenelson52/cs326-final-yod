# Milestone 0
***Game Tracker***
*Team Yod*

## Team Overview
Made by Connor Nelson *(cenelson52)*, Joseph O'Leary *(jpoleary)*, and Dang Le Nguyen *(dang592)*.

## Innovative Idea
We will be creating a website that can be used to log game statistics, including wins, losses, and different in-game performance stats. Users will be able to create a game, along with different statistics to be tracked for that game, and players in the game. They will then be able to track the performance of all the players, make balanced teams, and create tournament sheets based off the statistics in the website. This site could be used for all sorts of games, from sports to online gaming tournaments and completely made up games altogether!

## Important Components

- The ability to create Custom Games
- Add players to Games
